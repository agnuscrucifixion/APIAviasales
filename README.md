I used modern technologies used in many companies: Liquibase for creating tables in the database,
Swagger and Postman for documentation and convenient manual testing of APIs, Spring (boot, web,
data) framework, Hibernate as ORM framework, PostgreSQL for working with the database, Mupstruct
for mapping entities inside the programm, message brokers such as RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka were 
used to pass responses from one service to another and alert the user and Git for tracking application 
version updates.
